# Node.js Installation
The scripts provided in this directory can be used to agnostically build, install, test and deploy [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) applications using `bash`.

The script utilizes [nvm (Node Version Management)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) so each application can define it's own `.nvmrc` file that contains the version of Node.js that should be used to build, deploy and run the app. The [`nvmrc.sh`](nvmrc.sh) script is internally called by [`node-app.sh`](node-app.sh) and will ensure that the Node.js version defined within the `.nvmrc` file is installed and used during builds and deployments as well as the version used for the running app. The `.nvmrc` file can also contain a [Node.js codename](https://github.com/nodejs/Release/blob/master/CODENAMES.md). In which case, the latest derived Node.js version for the defined codename will be installed and used during builds and deployments as well as the version used for the running app.

## Build
The following steps are performed by [`node-app.sh`](node-app.sh) for a `BUILD` (for clarity, error handling is excluded from diagram):

## Deployment
The following steps are performed by [`node-app.sh`](node-app.sh) for a `DEPLOY*` (for clarity, error handling is excluded from diagram):

## Node.js Install (from `.nvmrc` file)
Internally, [`node-app.sh`](node-app.sh) calls [`nvmrc.sh`](nvmrc.sh) (as seen in the previous diagrams). The following steps are performed by [`nvmrc.sh`](nvmrc.sh) (for clarity, error handling is excluded from diagram):

## Build/Deploy Script
The [`node-app.sh`](node-app.sh) should be executed using the following paramters:

- __Execution type__ - either `BUILD`, `DEPLOY` or `DEPLOY_CLEAN`
- __The application's name__ - will be used for generated artifact names, systemd services, etc. (must contain only alpha characters)
- __NODE_ENV__ - the environmental veriable that will be set when running the Node.js app
- __Dir path for artifacts__ - for build, this will be where the built/compressed archive will be placed as well as the copied configuration properties file. for deployments, this is where the built atifact/archive and the copied configuration properties will be read from (each will be named `<APP_NAME>.tar.gz` and `<APP_NAME>.properties`, respectively)

Examples:

```sh
# Build the app using the specified artifacts dest dir
node-app.sh BUILD myAppName development "./artifacts"
# Deploy the app using the specified artifacts source dir
node-app.sh DEPLOY myAppName test "/tmp"
# Clean the app and corresponding systemd services
# and redeploy the app using the specified artifacts
# source dir
node-app.sh DEPLOY_CLEAN myAppName production "/tmp"
```

Each application should contain a `node-app.properties` file in the _root_ directory fo the application. Properties contained in the file define different options that will be used for the build and deployment processes. The configuration `.proerties` file can contain the following properties:

```sh

# NOTE: during DEPLOY the generated BUILD

## Build Script
A simple/portable bash script can be used in the `BUILD` task:

```sh
# run the script that will build, install Node.js from the apps
# .nvmrc version (if needed), tests the app (optional), bundles
# the app (optional, e.g. webpack, snowpack, etc.) and generates
# a single compressed archive artifact (optional)
# NOTE: assumes node-app.properties resides in the root dir of the app
##################################################################################
# $1 Execution type (required: either BUILD, DEPLOY or DEPLOY_CLEAN)
# $2 The app name (required: must contain only alpha characters)
# $3 The NODE_ENV value that will be set when the app is ran (optional: set when app is ran)
# $4 Dir path for artifacts (the archive and conf properties will be placed/extracted to/from)
APP_NAME=myapp
REPO_VER=v0.0.0 # real version here
WRK_DIR=/tmp/$APP_NAME
rm -fr $WRK_DIR && mkdir -p $WRK_DIR
wget -N -O $WRK_DIR/nvmrc.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ugate/repo/$REPO_VER/nodejs/nvmrc.sh
wget -N -O $WRK_DIR/node-app.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ugate/repo/$REPO_VER/nodejs/node-app.sh
chmod +x $WRK_DIR/nvmrc.sh
chmod +x $WRK_DIR/node-app.sh
$WRK_DIR/node-app.sh BUILD $APP_NAME test "./artifacts"
exit $?
```

Using the example above and assuming `./node-app.properties` contains `app.name=myapp`, the `BUILD` task will generate the following artifacts:

- `./artifacts/myapp.tar.gz` (contains the built app contents)
- `./artifacts/myapp.properties` (contains the original `./node-app.properties` that will be needed during deployment)

## Deploy Script
A simple/portable bash script can be used in the `DEPLOY` or `DEPLOY_CLEN` task:

```sh
# run the script that will build, install Node.js from the apps
# .nvmrc version (if needed), tests the app (optional), bundles
# the app (optional, e.g. webpack, snowpack, etc.) and generates
# a single compressed archive artifact (optional)
# NOTE: assumes /tmp/$APP_NAME.tar.gz and /tmp/$APP_NAME.properties files exist
##################################################################################
# $1 Execution type (required: either BUILD, DEPLOY or DEPLOY_CLEAN)
# $2 The app name (required: must contain only alpha characters)
# $3 The NODE_ENV value that will be set when the app is ran (optional: set when app is ran)
# $4 Dir path for artifacts (the archive and conf properties will be placed/extracted to/from)
APP_NAME=myapp
REPO_VER=v0.0.0 # real version here
WRK_DIR=/tmp/$APP_NAME
rm -fr $WRK_DIR && mkdir -p $WRK_DIR
wget -N -O $WRK_DIR/nvmrc.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ugate/repo/$REPO_VER/nodejs/nvmrc.sh
wget -N -O $WRK_DIR/node-app.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ugate/repo/$REPO_VER/nodejs/node-app.sh
chmod +x $WRK_DIR/nvmrc.sh
chmod +x $WRK_DIR/node-app.sh
$WRK_DIR/node-app.sh DEPLOY $APP_NAME test "/tmp"
exit $?
```
